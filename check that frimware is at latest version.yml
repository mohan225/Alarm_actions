check that frimware is at latest version or not for vmware
To check the firmware version of a VMware virtual machine, you can use the vSphere client or the VMware ESXi host client.

In the vSphere client, navigate to the virtual machine in question, and select the "Summary" tab. The firmware version will be listed under "Hardware" or "BIOS Version".

In the VMware ESXi host client, navigate to the virtual machine in question, and select the "Hardware" tab. The firmware version will be listed under "Firmware".

If you want to check all virtual machines firmware version you can use PowerCLI script

Copy code
get-vm | select name,@{N="BIOS Version";E={$_.ExtensionData.Summary.Config.Firmware}}
If you find that the firmware version is out of date, you can update it by following the instructions provided by the manufacturer of your virtual machine.

check that firmware is at latest version or not for vmware with yml
You can use a YAML file to automate the process of checking the firmware version of a VMware virtual machine and compare it with the latest version available. Here's an example of a YAML file that does this using the vSphere PowerCLI module:

Copy code
name: Check VMware Firmware Version
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'
jobs:
  check_firmware:
    runs-on: windows-latest
    steps:
    - name: Check firmware version
      run: |
        $vms = Get-VM
        foreach($vm in $vms) {
          $firmware = $vm.ExtensionData.Summary.Config.Firmware
          Write-Host "Firmware version for VM $($vm.Name) is $firmware"
          if($firmware -ne (Get-LatestFirmwareVersion -vm $vm)) {
            Write-Host "The firmware version for VM $($vm.Name) is out of date. Latest version is $(Get-LatestFirmwareVersion -vm $vm)"
          }
        }

This YAML file uses the PowerCLI script mentioned above to check the firmware version of all virtual machines, and compares it with the latest version available.

This script also uses schedule trigger cron job to run the script at specific time.

You can use this file with Github Actions, Azure pipeline, or any other CI/CD tool to schedule the script and check the firmware version of your virtual machines regularly.

develop a end to end method to check that firmware is at latest version or not for vmware with ansible
Ansible is a powerful automation tool that can be used to check the firmware version of a VMware virtual machine and compare it with the latest version available. Here's an example of an end-to-end method for doing this using Ansible:

First, you will need to install the VMware modules for Ansible. You can do this by running the command ansible-galaxy collection install vmware.vmware_rest

Create a new Ansible playbook with the following content:

Copy code
- name: Check VMware Firmware Version
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  vars:
    vcenter_hostname: vcenter.example.com
    vcenter_username: administrator@vsphere.local
    vcenter_password: password
    validate_certs: False
  tasks:
  - name: Get all VMs
    vmware_guest_facts:
      hostname: "{{ vcenter_hostname }}"
      username: "{{ vcenter_username }}"
      password: "{{ vcenter_password }}"
      validate_certs: "{{ validate_certs }}"
    register: all_vms
  - name: Check firmware version
    debug:
      msg: "Firmware version for VM {{ item.name }} is {{ item.hw_firmware_version }}"
    loop: "{{ all_vms.instance }}"
    when: item.hw_firmware_version != get_latest_firmware_version(item.name)

This playbook uses the vmware_guest_facts module to gather information about all virtual machines in the vCenter server specified in the vars section.
It then iterates through the virtual machines and check the firmware version of each one with a function called get_latest_firmware_version, which you will need to create.

Create a python script, for example check_firmware_version.py, with the following content:

Copy code

import requests
def get_latest_firmware_version(vm_name):
    url = f'https://example.com/firmware_versions/{vm_name}.txt'
    response = requests.get(url)
    return response.text

This script uses the python requests library to make a GET request to a website that maintains the latest firmware version for each virtual machine. 
You will need to replace the example URL with the actual URL for the website that maintains your firmware versions.

Finally, run the playbook using the command ansible-playbook check_firmware.yml.
This will execute the tasks in the playbook, and check the firmware version of each virtual machine against the latest version available.

This is an example of how you can use Ansible to check the firmware version of VMware virtual machines and compare it with the latest version available. 
You can further customize this method to fit your specific needs and environment.

end to end method to check that firmware is at latest version or not for vmware with ansible
An end-to-end method to check the firmware version of a VMware virtual machine using Ansible would involve the following steps:

Install the necessary Ansible VMware modules. This can be done by running the command ansible-galaxy collection install vmware.vmware_rest.

Create an Ansible playbook that uses the vmware_guest_facts module to gather information about all virtual machines in the vCenter server. You can define the connection details to vCenter in the playbook itself or in the inventory file.

Create a task that iterates through the virtual machines and check the firmware version of each one. You can use the hw_firmware_version variable that is returned by the vmware_guest_facts module.

Compare the firmware version of each virtual machine with the latest version available. This can be done by creating a function that makes a GET request to a website that maintains the latest firmware versions, or by using a variable that stores the latest firmware versions.

Use the when clause in the task to only execute the debug or notify task if the firmware version is out of date.

You can run this playbook as a cron job on a schedule or by using a CI/CD tool like Jenkins, Travis or Gitlab-CI.

Here's an example of a playbook that does this:

Copy code
- name: Check VMware Firmware Version
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  vars:
    vcenter_hostname: vcenter.example.com
    vcenter_username: administrator@vsphere.local
    vcenter_password: password
    validate_certs: False
  tasks:
  - name: Get all VMs
    vmware_guest_facts:
      hostname: "{{ vcenter_hostname }}"
      username: "{{ vcenter_username }}"
      password: "{{ vcenter_password }}"
      validate_certs: "{{ validate_certs }}"
    register: all_vms

  - name: Check firmware version
    debug:
      msg: "Firmware version for VM {{ item.name }} is {{ item.hw_firmware_version }} and it's out of date. Latest version is {{ get_latest_firmware_version(item.name) }}"
    loop: "{{ all_vms.instance }}"
    when: item.hw_firmware_version != get_latest_firmware_version(item.name)
   
  - name: Notify
    local_action:
      module: slack
      token: "{{ slack_token }}"
      channel: "#general"
      msg: "Firmware version for VM {{ item.name }} is {{ item.hw_firmware_version }} and it's out of date. Latest version is {{ get_latest_firmware_version(item.name) }}"
    loop: "{{ all_vms.instance }}"
    when: item.hw_firmware_version != get_latest_firmware_version(item.name)
This playbook uses the vmware_guest_facts module to gather information about all virtual machines in the vCenter server specified in the vars section.
It then iterates through the virtual machines and check the firmware version of each one with a function called `get_latest_firmware

develop a method to chec kthe host is not running on Evaluation license
An end-to-end method to check if a VMware host is not running on an evaluation license using Ansible would involve the following steps:

Create a new Ansible playbook that uses the vmware_host_facts module to gather information about all hosts in the vCenter server.
Copy code
- name: Check VMware Host License
  hosts: vcenter
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
  - name: Get all Hosts
    vmware_host_facts:
    register: all_hosts
Create a task that iterates through the hosts and check the license type of each one. You can use the license_key variable that is returned by the vmware_host_facts module.
Copy code
- name: Check host license type
    debug:
      msg: "License type for host {{ item.name }} is {{ item.license_key }}"
    loop: "{{ all_hosts.instance }}"
Check if the license type of the host is an evaluation license. This can be done by comparing the license_key variable to a predefined string that represents an evaluation license.
Copy code
- name: Check if host is running on evaluation license
    debug:
      msg: "Host {{ item.name }} is running on an evaluation license"
    loop: "{{ all_hosts.instance }}"
    when: item.license_key == "EVAL"

Run the playbook against the vCenter server by providing the inventory file containing the connection details to the vCenter server.

Copy code

ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml check_host_license.yml
The output of the playbook will indicate if any of the hosts are running on an evaluation license.

Based on the output, you can take appropriate actions such as upgrading the license or disabling the host.

Note: The license key returned by the vmware_host_facts module might be different for different versions of vSphere. 
It is recommended to check the documentation of your vSphere version for the correct license key.
