check the capacity of cluster with vrops
To check the capacity of a cluster with vRealize Operations (vROPS), you can use the "Capacity Overview" dashboard. This dashboard provides a summary of the current capacity usage and remaining capacity for various resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage. It also provides a forecast of future capacity usage and potential bottlenecks.
Additionally, you can use the "Capacity Remaining" metric to see the remaining capacity for a specific resource. This can be found by going to the "Environment" tab, selecting a cluster, and then selecting the specific resource you want to check.

check the capacity of cluster with vrops using ansible
You can use the Ansible VMware vRealize Operations (vROPS) module to check the capacity of a cluster with vROPS.

Here is an example of how you can use Ansible to check the capacity of a cluster named "mycluster":

yaml
Copy code
- name: Check cluster capacity
  vrops_cluster_capacity:
    hostname: "vrops.example.com"
    username: "admin"
    password: "password"
    validate_certs: False
    cluster_name: "mycluster"
  register: cluster_capacity

- debug:
    var: cluster_capacity
This will return the capacity usage and remaining capacity for various resources such as CPU, memory, and storage for the specified cluster.

You can also use the vRealize Operations (vROPS) Rest API to get the capacity of the cluster with Ansible by sending the GET request on the endpoint you want to check.

You will need to create a playbook that calls the vROPS Rest API, and parse the JSON output to extract the information you need about the cluster capacity.

check the capacity of cluster with vrops api using ansible
Yes, you can use the vRealize Operations (vROPS) REST API to check the capacity of a cluster with Ansible.

Here is an example of how you can use Ansible to check the capacity of a cluster named "mycluster" using the vROPS REST API:

yaml
Copy code
- name: Get vROPS token
  uri:
    url: "https://vrops.example.com/suite-api/api/auth/token/acquire"
    method: POST
    user: "admin"
    password: "password"
    validate_certs: False
    body: "grant_type=password&username=admin&password=password"
    headers:
      Content-Type: "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
  register: vrops_token

- name: Check cluster capacity
  uri:
    url: "https://vrops.example.com/suite-api/api/resources?name=mycluster&type=ClusterComputeResource"
    method: GET
    headers:
      Authorization: "{{ vrops_token.json.token_type }} {{ vrops_token.json.access_token }}"
      Content-Type: "application/json"
  register: cluster_capacity

- debug:
    var: cluster_capacity
This will return the capacity usage and remaining capacity for various resources such as CPU, memory, and storage for the specified cluster.

Please note that the above example is just an example, you may need to adjust the endpoints and the parameters of the API calls depending on your vROPS version.

Additionally, you can use Ansible modules like uri or httpapi modules to send the REST API requests and get the response and then parse the response in json format to get the capacity information.

implementation plan for the change of NPIDs in production created in Jira to action password change or account removed and replaced
Here is an example of an implementation plan for the change of NPIDs (Non-Production Identifiers) in production, created in Jira to action password change or account removal and replacement:

Identify Non-Production Identifiers: Use a tool or script to identify NPIDs in the production environment. This could include searching for specific patterns in usernames, email addresses, or data that indicate it is non-production.

Create Jira tickets: For each NPID identified in step 1, create a Jira ticket with the appropriate level of priority. These tickets should include the NPID, the reason why it is non-production, and any relevant details about the associated user or data.

Assign tickets to responsible parties: Assign the Jira tickets to the appropriate teams or individuals responsible for resolving the NPID. This could include security, IT, or data management teams.

Implement resolution: Based on the priority of the Jira ticket, implement the resolution for the NPID. This could include changing the password for the NPID, disabling the account, or removing the NPID and replacing it with a production identifier.

Test and validate: Test and validate the resolution implemented in step 4 to ensure that it has been successful and that the NPID is no longer present in the production environment.

Close Jira tickets: Once the resolution has been successfully implemented and tested, close the Jira ticket.

Document and Audit: Document the NPID and the resolution implemented in a central location and conduct regular audits to ensure that all NPIDs have been identified and resolved.

It's important to note that this is a general plan, specific steps may vary depending on your organization's environment, security policies, and compliance requirements.

It's also important to have a clear communication plan with stakeholders, especially if the NPID is used by certain business critical applications.

write a playbook for the change of NPIDs in production created in Jira to action password change or account removed and replaced
Here is an example of an Ansible playbook for the change of NPIDs (Non-Production Identifiers) in production, to action password change or account removal and replacement:

yaml
Copy code
---
- name: Change NPIDs in production
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  vars:
    npids: "{{ lookup('file', 'path/to/npids.yml') }}"
  tasks:
  - name: Change password for NPIDs
    user:
      name: "{{ item.username }}"
      password: "{{ item.password }}"
      update_password: always
    when: item.action == "password_change"
    with_items: "{{ npids }}"
  - name: Remove account for NPIDs
    user:
      name: "{{ item.username }}"
      state: absent
    when: item.action == "account_removal"
    with_items: "{{ npids }}"
This playbook uses the user module to change the password or remove the account for the NPIDs listed in the npids variable. The npids variable is populated with data from a YAML file, which should contain a list of NPIDs with the following format:

yaml
Copy code
- username: NPID1
  action: password_change
  password: new_password
- username: NPID2
  action: account_removal
The playbook uses the when clause to check the value of the action variable for each NPID and perform the appropriate action, either changing the password or removing the account.

It's important to note that this is a basic example and may need to be adjusted for your specific environment and requirements. Also, it's important to test this playbook in a non-production environment before running it in production.

Close Jira tickets: Once the resolution has been successfully implemented and tested, close the Jira ticket.

Document and Audit: Document the NPID and the resolution implemented in a central location and conduct regular audits to ensure that all NPIDs have been identified and resolved.

It's important to note that this is a general plan, specific steps may vary depending on your organization's environment, security policies, and compliance requirements.

It's also important to have a clear communication plan with stakeholders, especially if the NPID is used by certain business critical applications.

create a playbook to change of NPIDs in production created in Jira to action password change or account removed and replaced
Here is an example of an Ansible playbook for changing NPIDs (Non-Production Identifiers) in production, to action password change or account removal and replacement:

yaml
Copy code
---
- name: Change NPIDs in production
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  vars:
    npids: "{{ lookup('file', 'path/to/npids.yml') }}"
  tasks:
  - name: Change password for NPIDs
    user:
      name: "{{ item.username }}"
      password: "{{ item.password }}"
      update_password: always
    when: item.action == "password_change"
    with_items: "{{ npids }}"
  - name: Remove account for NPIDs
    user:
      name: "{{ item.username }}"
      state: absent
    when: item.action == "account_removal"
    with_items: "{{ npids }}"
This playbook uses the user module to change the password or remove the account for the NPIDs listed in the npids variable. The npids variable is populated with data from a YAML file, which should contain a list of NPIDs with the following format:

yaml
Copy code
- username: NPID1
  action: password_change
  password: new_password
- username: NPID2
  action: account_removal
The playbook uses the when clause to check the value of the action variable for each NPID and perform the appropriate action, either changing the password or removing the account.

It's important to note that this is a basic example and may need to be adjusted for your specific environment and requirements. Also, it's important to test this playbook

automate enabling/disabling of alarm actions when host is disconnected, maintenance mode, not responding using vrops by python code
Here is an example of Python code that can automate the enabling and disabling of alarm actions when a host is disconnected, in maintenance mode, or not responding, using vRealize Operations (vROps) API:

python
Copy code
import requests
import json

# Set vROps API endpoint and credentials
vrops_url = "https://vrops.example.com/suite-api"
vrops_username = "admin"
vrops_password = "password"

# Define the alarm action and status
alarm_action = "notify"
status = "enabled"

# Define the host conditions
host_conditions = ["disconnected", "maintenance", "not responding"]

# Get the list of alarms and the corresponding action status
alarms = json.loads(requests.get(vrops_url + "/alarms", auth=(vrops_username, vrops_password)).text)["alarm"]

for alarm in alarms:
    # Check if the alarm action is the one we want to update
    if alarm["action"] == alarm_action:
        # Get the alarm details
        alarm_details = json.loads(requests.get(alarm["links"][0]["href"], auth=(vrops_username, vrops_password)).text)
        # Check if the host condition is one of the ones we want to update
        if alarm_details["resourceKind"] == "Host" and alarm_details["condition"] in host_conditions:
            # Update the alarm action status
            alarm_details["enabled"] = status
            # Send the update to vROps
            requests.put(alarm["links"][0]["href"], auth=(vrops_username, vrops_password), json=alarm_details)

print("Alarm actions updated successfully")
This code uses the requests library to make API calls to the vROps endpoint. It first retrieves a list of all the alarms, and then loops through them to check if the alarm action and host condition match the ones we want to update. If they do, it updates the alarm action status and sends the update to vROPS.

It's important to note that this is a basic example and may need to be adjusted for your specific environment and requirements. Also, it's important to test this code in a non-production environment before running it in production.

Also, it's very important to make sure the endpoint url, username and password are correct, and also make sure the python script has the necessary libraries installed, such as 'requests' library.

develop a method to automate enabling/disabling of alarm actions when host is disconnected, maintenance mode, not responding using vrops by python 
Here is a method for automating the enabling and disabling of alarm actions when a host is disconnected, in maintenance mode, or not responding, using vRealize Operations (vROps) and Python:

Retrieve vROps credentials: Retrieve the vROps endpoint URL, username, and password to be used for the API calls.

Define alarm action and status: Define the alarm action (e.g. "notify") and the status (e.g. "enabled" or "disabled") that you want to update.

Define host conditions: Define the host conditions (e.g. "disconnected", "maintenance", "not responding") for which you want to enable/disable the alarm actions.

Retrieve alarms: Use the vROps API to retrieve a list of all the alarms and their details.

Loop through alarms: Loop through the list of alarms and check if the alarm action and host condition match the ones you want to update.

Update alarm action status: If the alarm action and host condition match, update the alarm action status to the desired value.

Send update to vROps: Use the vROps API to send the update for the alarm action status.

Monitor and validate: Monitor the environment for a sufficient amount of time to ensure that the alarm actions have been updated as expected and that no issues have been caused by the update.

Document and Audit: Document the changes made and conduct regular audits to ensure that the alarm actions are updated as expected.

It's important to note that this is a general plan, specific steps may vary depending on your organization's environment, security policies, and compliance requirements.

It's also important to have a clear communication plan with stakeholders, especially if the alarm actions are used by certain business critical applications.

You can also make the code more sophisticated by adding error handling, logging, and testing to make it more robust.
