        new_username: "{{ new_username }}"
        new_password: "{{ new_password }}"


Here is an example of how you might develop a complete end-to-end method using a YAML script, Ansible, and Ansible vault to automate updating vCenter credentials and scheduling a cron job for regular updates:

Create a YAML file called update_credentials.yml that defines the tasks needed to update the vCenter credentials.

- name: Update vCenter Credentials
  hosts: localhost
  vars_files:
    - vars/vcenter_credentials.yml
  tasks:
    - name: Update vCenter Credentials
      vcenter_credentials:
        hostname: "{{ vcenter_hostname }}"
        username: "{{ vcenter_username }}"
        password: "{{ vcenter_password }}"
        new_username: "{{ new_username }}"
        new_password: "{{ new_password }}"
        
        
Create a YAML file called vars/vcenter_credentials.yml that contains the vCenter credentials and new credentials as variables. This file should be encrypted using Ansible Vault.

vcenter_hostname: vcenter.example.com
vcenter_username: admin
vcenter_password: old_password
new_username: new_admin
new_password: new_password

Run the playbook with the following command, providing the vault password when prompted:

ansible-playbook update_credentials.yml --ask-vault-pass

This will update the vCenter credentials with the new username and password provided in the variables new_username and new_password.

Create a cron job to run the playbook regularly, for example, every month. You can use the following command to schedule a cron job:

crontab -e

Then add this line to schedule the playbook to run every month:

0 0 1 * * ansible-playbook /path/to/update_credentials.yml --ask-vault-pass


This way the credentials will be automatically updated every month and the vCenter credentials are secured with Ansible vault.
It's important to mention that the vcenter_credentials module should be installed before using it, also the script should be adapted to the specific vCenter version in use.

Additionally, it's important to review the cron
