develop a method to check the host is not running on Evaluation license and disable the server if it is on Evaluation license with ansible
Here is a possible method to check if a host is running on an Evaluation license and disable the server if it is, using Ansible:

Create a new Ansible playbook to run the check and disable the server.

Use the shell module to run a command that checks the license status on the host. For example, you can use the grep command to check for the word "Evaluation" in the output of the license status command.

Use the register keyword to store the output of the shell command in a variable.

Use the when keyword to check if the variable contains the word "Evaluation".

Use the service module to stop the server service if the host is running on an Evaluation license.

Example:

Copy code
---
- name: Check and disable server on Evaluation license
  hosts: all
  vars:
    service_name: "{{ service_name }}"
  tasks:
  - name: Check license status
    shell: "license-status | grep Evaluation"
    register: license_status

  - name: Disable server if on Evaluation license
    service:
      name: "{{ service_name }}"
      state: stopped
    when: license_status.stdout.find("Evaluation") != -1
You can also use ansible module like win_license and win_product_key to check the license information on windows server.

develop a method to check the vmware host is not running on Evaluation license and disable the server if it is on Evaluation license with ansible
Here is a possible method to check if a VMware host is running on an Evaluation license and disable the server if it is, using Ansible:

Create a new Ansible playbook to run the check and disable the server.

Use the vmware_license module to check the license information on the host.

Use the register keyword to store the output of the vmware_license command in a variable.

Use the when keyword to check if the license is an evaluation license.

Use the vmware_host module to disable the host if it is running on an Evaluation license.

Example:

Copy code
---
- name: Check and disable VMware host on Evaluation license
  hosts: localhost
  vars:
    vcenter_hostname: "{{ vcenter_hostname }}"
    vcenter_username: "{{ vcenter_username }}"
    vcenter_password: "{{ vcenter_password }}"

This content may violate our content policy. If you believe this to be in error, please submit your feedback â€” your input will aid our research in this area.
Here is a possible method to get a list of VMware hosts that are running on an Evaluation license using Python and the pyVmomi library:

Import the necessary libraries, such as pyVmomi and ssl.

Connect to the vCenter server using the SmartConnect method, providing the vCenter server's hostname or IP, username, and password.

Retrieve all the hosts managed by the vCenter server using the content.rootFolder.childEntity property.

Iterate through the hosts and use the config.product.licenseProductName property to check the license type.

If the license type is "VMware vSphere Hypervisor", append the hostname to a list of hosts on Evaluation license.

Example:

Copy code
from pyVim.connect import SmartConnect
from pyVmomi import vim
import ssl

# vCenter server details
vc_host = 'vcenter.example.com'
vc_user = 'username'
vc_pass = 'password'

# disable SSL certificate verification
context = ssl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1)
context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_NONE

# connect to vCenter
si = SmartConnect(host=vc_host, user=vc_user, pwd=vc_pass, sslContext=context)

# get all hosts
hosts = si.content.rootFolder.childEntity[0].hostFolder.childEntity

# list to store hosts on evaluation license
eval_hosts = []

# iterate through hosts
for host in hosts:
    # check if license is evaluation
    if host.config.product.licenseProductName == "VMware vSphere Hypervisor":
        eval_hosts.append(host.name)

# output list of hosts on evaluation license
print(eval_hosts)
You should also replace the placeholders vcenter_hostname, vcenter_username, vcenter_password with the appropriate values in your environment.

3 / 3

Here is a possible method to get a list of VMware hosts that are running on an Evaluation license using the vROps API:

Authenticate to the vROps API using the requests library in Python. The vROps API uses basic authentication, so you will need to pass in the vROps username and password in the headers of the request.

Use the requests.get() method to query the vROps API for the list of hosts. The URL to query will be in the format https://vrops_hostname/suite-api/api/resources?resourceKind=host

Parse the JSON response to get the list of hosts.

Iterate through the hosts and check the license property to see if the host is running on an Evaluation license.

Append the hostname to a list of hosts on Evaluation license if the license is Evaluation.

Example:

Copy code
import requests
import json

# vROps server details
vrops_host = 'vrops.example.com'
vrops_user = 'username'
vrops_pass = 'password'

# authenticate to vROps API
auth = requests.auth.HTTPBasicAuth(vrops_user, vrops_pass)

# get list of hosts
url = 'https://' + vrops_host + '/suite-api/api/resources?resourceKind=host'
response = requests.get(url, auth=auth, verify=False)

# parse JSON response
hosts = json.loads(response.text)['resourceList']

# list to store hosts on evaluation license

end to end method to get the list of vmware hosts is  running on Evaluation license using vrops api with ansible playbook
In the playbook, you need to create a variable file vars.yml containing the vROps server's hostname or IP, and the API token.

Copy code
vrops_host: "vrops.example.com"
api_token: "API_TOKEN"

You can use the uri ansible module to make a GET request to the vROps API endpoint for retrieving license information.
The headers option is used to include the Authorization header with the value vRealizeOpsToken {{ api_token }}, where api_token is your vROps API token.
The register keyword is used to store the output of the request in a variable.
The json_query filter is used to extract the license information from the response.
The when keyword is used to check if the license type is "evaluation"
The debug module is used to output the hostname of the host if it is running on an Evaluation license.

You need to run the playbook by providing the variable file

Copy code
ansible-playbook -i "localhost," -c local playbook.yml --extra-vars "@vars.yml"
This is a basic example, you may also need to adapt it to your specific use case and also need to check the vROps API documentation for the exact endpoint and structure of the response you are getting.

develop a method to get  the list of vmware hosts is  running on Evaluation license using vrops api with ansible playbook

3 / 3

Here is a possible method to get a list of VMware hosts that are running on an Evaluation license using the vROps API and Ansible:

Create a new Ansible playbook to run the check.

Use the uri module to make a GET request to the vROps API endpoint for retrieving license information. The endpoint will be in the format https://vrops.example.com/suite-api/api/licenses

Use the register keyword to store the output of the uri command in a variable.

Use the json filter to parse the JSON response and extract the license information.

Use a loop to iterate through the hosts and use the when keyword to check if the licenseType is "evaluation".

Use the debug module to output the hostname of the host if it is running on an Evaluation license.

Example:

Copy code
---
- name: Get list of VMware hosts on Evaluation license
  hosts: localhost
  vars:
    vrops_host: "vrops.example.com"
    api_token: "API_TOKEN"
  tasks:
  - name: Get license information from vROps
    uri:
      url: "https://{{ vrops_host }}/suite-api/api/licenses"
      headers:
        Authorization: "vRealizeOpsToken {{ api_token }}"
      method: GET
    register: license_info

  - name: Output hostname if on Evaluation license
    debug:
      msg: "{{ item.hostName }} is on Evaluation license"
    loop: "{{ license_info.json.licenses }}"
    when: item.licenseType == "evaluation"
You should also replace the placeholders vrops_host, api_token with the appropriate values in your environment.

This is a basic example, you may also need to adapt it to your specific use case.

- end to end check the vmware host is not running on Evaluation license with ansible and using vrops api
An end-to-end method to check if a VMware host is not running on an evaluation license using Ansible and the vRealize Operations (vROps) API would involve the following steps:

Create a new Ansible playbook and install the python module vrops-client which is a python wrapper for the vROps REST API.
Copy code
- name: Install vROps python module
  pip:
    name: vrops-client
Create a task to import the vROps python module and to connect to the vROps server using the vROps API endpoint, username and password
Copy code
- name: Connect to vROps
  set_fact:
    vrops_connection: "{{ lookup('vrops_client', endpoint='https://vrops.example.com', username='username', password='password') }}"
Create a task that uses the vROps python module to gather information about all hosts in the vCenter server and their license keys.
Copy code
- name: Get all Hosts
  set_fact:
    all_hosts: "{{ vrops_connection.get_entities('HostSystem') }}"
Create a task that iterates through the hosts and check the license type of each one.
Copy code
- name: Check host license type
  debug:
    msg: "License type for host {{ item.name }} is {{ item.license_key }}"
  loop: "{{ all_hosts.resources }}"
Check if the license type of the host is an evaluation license. This can be done by comparing the license_key variable to a predefined string that represents an evaluation license.
Copy code
- name: Check if host is running on evaluation license
    debug:
      msg: "Host {{ item.name }} is running on an evaluation license"
    loop: "{{ all_hosts.resources }}"
    when: item.license_key == "EVAL"
Run the playbook against the vROps server
Copy code
ansible-playbook check_host_license.yml
The output of the playbook will indicate if any of the hosts are running on an evaluation license.

Based on the output, you can take appropriate actions such as upgrading the license or disabling the host.

Note: The license key returned by the vROps API might be different for different versions of vSphere. It is recommended to check the documentation of your vSphere version for the correct license key.
Also you need to have a valid vROps license in order to use the vROps REST API.

Also, as a best practice, it is recommended to use Ansible vault or another secure method to store the vROps API credentials in order to protect them from unauthorized access.

Copy code
- name: Check host license type
  debug:
    msg: "License type for host {{ item.name }} is {{ item.license_key }}"
  loop: "{{ all_hosts.resources }}"
Check if the license type of the host is an evaluation license. This can be done by comparing the license_key variable to a predefined string that represents an evaluation license.
Copy code
- name: Check if host is running on evaluation license
    debug:
      msg: "Host {{ item.name }} is running on an evaluation license"
    loop: "{{ all_hosts.resources }}"
    when: item.license_key == "EVAL"
Create a task that disable the host which is running on evaluation license by calling the vROps python module method to disable the host
Copy code
- name: Disable host
    vrops_client.disable_host:
      host: "{{ item.name }}"
    loop: "{{ all_hosts.resources }}"
    when: item.license_key == "EVAL"
Run the playbook against the vROps server
Copy code

end to end to check and disable the vmware host which is running on Evaluation license  with yml 
Here is an end-to-end method to check and disable VMware hosts that are running on an Evaluation license using YAML configuration files and Ansible:

Create a YAML configuration file containing the vCenter server's hostname or IP, username, and password.

Create another YAML configuration file containing the vROps server's hostname or IP and the API token.

Create an Ansible playbook that uses the import_yaml module to read the configuration files and extract the necessary information.

Use the vmware_host module to check the license information on the host.

Use a loop to iterate through the hosts and use the when keyword to check if the license is an evaluation license.

Use the uri module to make a GET request to the vROps API endpoint for disabling the host.

Use the mail module to send an email notification after disabling the host

Example:

Copy code
- name: Check and disable VMware hosts on Evaluation license
  hosts: localhost
  vars_files:
    - vcenter.yml
    - vrops.yml
  tasks:
  - name: Check VMware host licenses
    vmware_host:
      hostname: "{{ vcenter_host }}"
      username: "{{ vcenter_user }}"
      password: "{{ vcenter_pass }}"
      hostname: "{{ item }}"
    register: license_status
    with_items: "{{ hostnames }}"

  - name: Disable host if on Evaluation license
    uri:
      url: "https://{{ vrops_host }}/suite-api/api/licenses/{{ item.hostName }}"
      headers:
        Authorization: "vRealizeOpsToken {{ api_token }}"
      method: DELETE
    when: license_status.license_key.startswith("EVAL")

    mail:
      host: smtp.example.com
      port: 587
      username: email@example.com
      password: email_password
      to: recipient@example.com
      subject: "Evaluation license hosts disabled"
      body: "The following hosts have been disabled due to running on an Evaluation license: {{ eval_hosts }}"
You will need to have pyVmomi python library installed and you can use pip install pyVmomi to install it.
You should also replace the placeholders vcenter_hostname, vcenter_username, vcenter_password, hostnames, vrops_host, api_token, smtp_host, smtp_port, email_username, email_password, recipient with the appropriate values in your environment.
hostnames should be list of hostnames you want to check for the license
You need to have smtp server configured to send the email.

end to end to check and disable the vmware host which is running on Evaluation license  with yml 
To check and disable a VMware host running on an evaluation license using a YAML file, you can use the vSphere Automation SDK for Python to write a script that connects to the vCenter server, identifies the host, and disables it. The script can then be run using a YAML file to specify the connection details and other necessary information.

To disable the host, you will need to use the method configManager.licenseManager.UpdateLicense with the spec property set to evaluation and the operation property set to remove.

It is important to note that disabling a host in this way will prevent it from being able to function, so it should only be done as a last resort. Additionally, you should ensure that you have a valid license for the host before disabling it.

 check and disable the vmware host which is running on Evaluation license  with yml 
To check and disable a VMware host running on an evaluation license using a YAML file, you can use the vSphere Automation SDK for Python to write a script that connects to the vCenter server, identifies the host, and disables it. The script can then be run using a YAML file to specify the connection details and other necessary information.

Here is an example of a script that connects to a vCenter server, checks if the host is running on an evaluation license and if so, disables the host:

Copy code
from pyVim.connect import SmartConnect, Disconnect
from pyVmomi import vim
import yaml

# Load the YAML file with the connection details
with open("config.yml", "r") as file:
    config = yaml.safe_load(file)

# Connect to the vCenter server
si = SmartConnect(host=config["vcenter"]["host"],
                  user=config["vcenter"]["user"],
                  pwd=config["vcenter"]["password"],
                  port=config["vcenter"]["port"])

# Get the license manager
license_manager = si.content.licenseManager

# Get the host system
host = si.content.searchIndex.FindByIp(None, config["host"]["ip"], False)

# Check if the host is running on an evaluation license
if license_manager.QueryAssignedLicense(host) == "evaluation":
    # Disable the host
    spec = vim.LicenseManager.EvaluationLicenseSpec()
    spec.operation = "remove"
    license_manager.UpdateLicense(spec)
    print("Host has been disabled.")
else:
    print("Host is not running on an evaluation license.")

# Disconnect from the vCenter server
Disconnect(si)
You have to have your vcenter and host detail in a yml file as show in the above code snippet and then run this script by providing the path of your yml file.

It is important to note that disabling a host in this way will prevent it from being able to function, so it should only be done as a last resort. Additionally, you should ensure that you have a valid license for the host before disabling it.

check the vmware host which is running on Evaluation license  with ansible
To check a VMware host to see if it is running on an evaluation license using Ansible, you can use the vSphere Ansible modules to connect to the vCenter server, identify the host, and check its license. Here's an example of how to do this:

Install the vSphere Ansible modules by running ansible-galaxy collection install vmware.vmware_rest.

Create a playbook with the following tasks:

Copy code
- name: Connect to vCenter
  vmware_rest:
    hostname: "{{ vcenter_hostname }}"
    username: "{{ vcenter_username }}"
    password: "{{ vcenter_password }}"
    validate_certs: no
  register: vcenter

- name: Find host by IP
  vmware_host:
    hostname: "{{ vcenter_hostname }}"
    username: "{{ vcenter_username }}"
    password: "{{ vcenter_password }}"
    validate_certs: no
    esxi_hostname: "{{ host_ip }}"
  register: host

- name: Check host license
  debug:
    msg: "Host is running on an evaluation license."
  when: host.host.config.licenseProductName == "VMware vSphere Hypervisor"
Replace {{ vcenter_hostname }}, {{ vcenter_username }}, {{ vcenter_password }}, and {{ host_ip }} with the appropriate values for your environment.

Run the playbook using the command ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini playbook.yml

If the host is running on an evaluation license, the debug task will output "Host is running on an evaluation license."

It is important to note that, the above example is just to check the host is running on evaluation license or not, disabling a host in this way will prevent it from being able to function, so it should only be done as a last resort. Additionally, you should ensure that you have a valid license for the host before disabling it.

    validate_certs: no
    esxi_hostname: "{{ host_ip }}"
    state: off
  when: host.host.config.licenseProductName == "VMware vSphere Hypervisor"
Replace {{ vcenter_hostname }}, {{ vcenter_username }}, {{ vcenter_password }}, and {{ host_ip }} with the appropriate values for your environment.

Run the playbook using the command ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini playbook.yml

If the host is running on an evaluation license, the vmware_host_power task will turn off the host.

Please be aware that disabling a host in this way will prevent it from being able to function, so it should only be done as a last resort. 
Additionally, you should ensure that you have a valid license for the host before disabling it and also make sure to have a plan in place to handle the impact of 
turning off the host in production environment.
